# Path-follow Rover

This project aimed to code a line-following car on a Texas Instrumentâ€™s Robotic System Learning Kit (TI-RSLK) using a closed-loop control system (PD) to enable the car to follow the given track, including navigating curves and making a donut turn in under 20 seconds.

This was project was completed with Anmol Gupta, my lab partner, as part of ECE 3 Spring 2022.
